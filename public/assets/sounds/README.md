You can download common meme sounds from YouTube or sound effect websites. For the "AAND PAV KHAYEGA?" phrase, you may need to record it yourself or use a text-to-speech service.

## Fallback Method

If actual sound files aren't available, the website has fallback mechanisms that will try:
1. Multiple file paths 
2. Alternative sounds if primary sounds fail to load
3. Continuing without sound as a last resort
